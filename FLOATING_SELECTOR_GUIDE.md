## How to Use in Shopify Admin

### 1. Add the Section
1. Go to **Online Store > Themes**
2. Click **Customize** on your active theme
3. Add a new section and select **"Floating Localization"**
4. The section works best in the **Header** area

### 2. Configure Settings
Available settings in the theme customizer:
- **Position**: Choose corner placement (bottom-right, bottom-left, top-right, top-left)
- **Collapsed button label**: Text shown on the collapsed button (default: "Region")
- **Expanded panel title**: Title in the expanded panel (default: "Select Your Preferences")
- **Dismiss button text**: Text for the dismiss button (default: "Don't show again")
- **Enable country selector**: Toggle country/region selection
- **Country selector label**: Label for country dropdown (default: "Country")
- **Enable language selector**: Toggle language selection  
- **Language selector label**: Label for language dropdown (default: "Language")

### 3. Prerequisites
Make sure you have:
- **Markets configured**: Go to Settings > Markets to set up countries/regions
- **Languages added**: Go to Settings > Languages to add additional languages

### 4. Test the Functionality
1. Save your changes in the theme customizer
2. Visit your storefront
3. Look for the floating selector in your chosen corner
4. Test the expand/collapse functionality
5. Try changing countries and languages to ensure forms submit correctly

## Design Customization
The selector uses your theme's CSS variables:
- `--color-background`: Background color
- `--color-foreground`: Text and border colors  
- `--color-base-accent-1`: Primary accent color for buttons and highlights

Colors will automatically match your theme's design.

## Mobile Behavior
- On mobile devices, the selector automatically moves to bottom-right corner
- Panel width adjusts to fit mobile screens
- Touch-friendly button sizes and spacing

## Browser Support
- Works in all modern browsers
- Includes fallbacks for older browsers
- Uses progressive enhancement for advanced features like backdrop blur

## Troubleshooting

### Selector Not Appearing
- Check that at least one selector (country or language) is enabled
- Verify the section is added to a template
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Selectors Not Working
- Confirm Markets are configured in Shopify Admin
- Verify Languages are added in Shopify Admin
- Check that the localization snippets exist (`country-localization.liquid` and `language-localization.liquid`)

### Styling Issues
- Ensure your theme includes the required CSS variables
- Check for CSS conflicts with other theme modifications
- Verify the section is loading after other theme styles

## Performance Notes
- The selector is lightweight and loads quickly
- Uses CSS animations for smooth interactions
- Session storage prevents unnecessary state resets
- JavaScript is optimized for performance

## Accessibility Features
- Full keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatible with proper ARIA labels
- Focus indicators for all interactive elements
- Semantic HTML structure
- High contrast support

This implementation provides a clean, modern alternative to traditional announcement bars while maintaining full localization functionality.
