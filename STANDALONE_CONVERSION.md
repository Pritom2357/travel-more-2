# Announcement Bar to Standalone Section Conversion

## Overview
The announcement-bar section has been successfully converted from being part of the header-group to a standalone normal section. This change allows for more flexible placement and management of the floating localization selector.

## Changes Made

### 1. Schema Updates
- **File**: `sections/announcement-bar.liquid`
- **Change**: Removed `"enabled_on": {"groups": ["header"]}` restriction
- **Result**: Section can now be used anywhere in the theme, not just in header groups

### 2. Header Group Configuration
- **File**: `sections/header-group.json`
- **Change**: Removed announcement-bar from the sections and order arrays
- **Result**: Header group now only contains the header section
- **Backup**: Created `header-group-backup.json` with original configuration

### 3. Theme Layout Integration
- **File**: `layout/theme.liquid`
- **Change**: Added standalone `{% section 'announcement-bar' %}` after header-group
- **Result**: Floating selector now loads independently of header group

## Benefits of Standalone Conversion

### ✅ Flexibility
- Can be placed anywhere in the theme layout
- Easy to enable/disable without affecting header functionality
- Can be moved to different positions (before/after header, in footer, etc.)

### ✅ Maintainability
- Independent configuration and settings
- Easier to debug and modify
- Cleaner separation of concerns

### ✅ Performance
- Only loads when explicitly included
- No dependency on header-group rendering
- Can be conditionally included based on requirements

### ✅ Accessibility
- Better control over DOM placement for screen readers
- Can be positioned for optimal keyboard navigation
- Independent focus management

## Current Configuration

The standalone announcement-bar section retains all its previous functionality:

```liquid
<!-- Placement in theme.liquid -->
{% section 'announcement-bar' %}
```

### Default Settings Applied
```json
{
  "position_class": "bottom-right",
  "collapsed_label": "Region",
  "expanded_title": "Select Your Preferences", 
  "dismiss_text": "Don't show again",
  "enable_country_selector": true,
  "country_label": "Country",
  "enable_language_selector": true,
  "language_label": "Language"
}
```

## Usage Instructions

### To Enable the Floating Selector
1. The section is now automatically included in `theme.liquid`
2. Configure settings in the Shopify admin under:
   - **Theme Editor** → **Sections** → **Announcement Bar**

### To Disable the Floating Selector
1. Remove or comment out `{% section 'announcement-bar' %}` from `theme.liquid`
2. Or disable both country and language selectors in the section settings

### To Move the Floating Selector
1. Cut `{% section 'announcement-bar' %}` from current location in `theme.liquid`
2. Paste it wherever you want it to appear (header, footer, specific templates)

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to revert to the header-group integration:

1. **Restore header-group.json**:
   ```bash
   cp header-group-backup.json sections/header-group.json
   ```

2. **Remove standalone section from theme.liquid**:
   Delete: `{% section 'announcement-bar' %}`

3. **Re-add header group restriction**:
   Add back to announcement-bar.liquid schema:
   ```json
   "enabled_on": {
     "groups": ["header"]
   }
   ```
